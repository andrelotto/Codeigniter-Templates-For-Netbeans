I make these by search in google. Feel free to use and modify it. These templates work on "Freemarker" that embed in Netbeans.

## How to use?
1. Open "ci_library.php" and edit "<your@email.com>" in line 11 to your email or you can remove if you don't want insert your email. Save it.
2. Open Netbeans and click "Tools" -> "Templates"
3. Add them!
